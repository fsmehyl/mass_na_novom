The aim of the bachelor's thesis is to design and implement a multiplatform prototype of an application enabling rapid diagnostic testing with a focus on the Flutter environment. The thesis contains a theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is dedicated to the description of multiplatform applications, their advantages and disadvantages, as well as a description of several tools for multiplatform development. It also contains a description of the Flutter tool, its characteristics, functionalities, architecture and the distribution of widgets based on the state. The practical part is dedicated to the rough design of the system and the complete application. It also contains the specification and design of the user interface for the created prototype, an analysis of the possibility of creating forms, as well as a description of the code for the implementation of individual components. The conclusion of the practical part is dedicated to testing, the result of which is the successful operation of the application on three platforms: Windows, Web and Android.
